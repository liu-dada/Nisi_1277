It contains some important functions and plotting R codes:

hr_Bootstrap.R function: using bootstrap methods to estimate 95% CI of hazard ratio;

hr_Asymptotic.R function: using asymptotic methods to calculate 95% CI of hazard ratio;

plot_Bootstrap.R: making hazard ratio plots for female and male from the output data of hr_Bootstrap();

plot_Asymptotic.R: making hazard ratio plots for female and male from the output data of hr_Asymptotic();

plot_2methods.R: comparing the hazard ratio and corresponding CI's;

band_Bootstrap.R: making band plot from the output data of hr_Bootstrap();

band_Asymptotic.R: making band plot from the output data of hr_Asymptotic();
