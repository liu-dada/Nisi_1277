# Temporal Efficacy Profiler (TEP)

This project focuses on the creation and validation of the TEP, a tool designed to assess and profile temporal efficacy on mortality hazard.

## Project Structure

### 1. Paper-Related-R-Codes

Description: This section contains all the R scripts used to create the TEP as described in the associated research paper.
Usage: Utilize these codes to replicate the methodology and results presented in the paper.
### 2. Simulation-Related-R-Codes

Description: This section provides R scripts for simulation testing, which are used to validate the performance of the TEP.
Usage: Use these codes to perform simulation studies and assess the robustness and accuracy of TEP under various scenarios.
### 3. User-Friendly-R-Code-with-Sample

Description: This section offers a user-friendly R script, accompanied by sample data, to facilitate the use of the TEP.
Usage: This script is designed for easy adoption and quick application, enabling users to implement TEP with minimal setup.
