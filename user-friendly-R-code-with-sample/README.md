### Introduction

This R code script is designed to simplify the comparison between two groups using TEP, making it accessible for users at all levels. The folder includes an Excel file and an R script that generate outputs from bootstrap and asymptotic methods, along with several visualizations such as Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots, hazard ratio plots, and the band-plot featured in our manuscript.

## Contents

Sample file.xlsx: A sample dataset to demonstrate the workflow.

TEP script.R: Contains multiple R functions to calculate and visualize outputs using bootstrap and asymptotic methods, with the option to export results as PNG files.

Detailed instructions are embedded within the script to guide you through each step.
