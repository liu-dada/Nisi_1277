It contains some important functions and plotting R codes for simulation:

simulation_func.R: using Gompertz distribution to simulate data for null and alternative scenario;

bootstrap_func.R: using bootstrap methods to estimate 95% CI of hazard ratio;

sim_asymptotic_func.R: using asymptotic method to estimate 95% CI of hazard ratio;

sim_fpr_func.R: calculating positive rate for the simulated data;

sim_null.R: simulating data for null scenario, and estimating and comparing hazard ratio and CI by bootstrap and asymptotic method;

sim_alter.R: simulating data for alternative scenario, and estimating and comparing hazard ratio and CI by bootstrap and asymptotic method;

sim_fpr_plot.R: plotting postive rate by days for bootstrap and asymptotic method;

sim_plot_null_alter: plotting hazard rate for null and alternative scenario.
